NetOpsBench is an open benchmark arena for agentic network troubleshooting — run reproducible fault scenarios on live SONiC-VS / Containerlab topologies, plug in any troubleshooting agent, and score it across quality and efficiency dimensions.

## Why NetOpsBench

Developing and evaluating agentic root cause analysis methods for network troubleshooting remains challenging, with three core bottlenecks hindering further advancement:

![NetOpsBench motivation](docs/public/assets/Motivation.png)

| Gap | The problem | How NetOpsBench closes it |
|---|---|---|
| **Vanishing faults** | Real network incidents resolve too fast to study or replay. Researchers can only chase snapshots after the fact. | Containerlab + SONiC-VS reproduce any fault deterministically. Every run is an identical, repeatable episode. |
| **Static data** | Existing datasets are frozen logs or hand-crafted prompts — no live telemetry, no interactive tool calls, no true cause-and-effect chain. | Agents operate inside a running network. Pingmesh, gNMI, sFlow, and syslog evidence is generated in real time during each episode. |
| **No fair arena** | Different teams evaluate on different topologies, different faults, and different metrics. Comparisons are meaningless. | A shared scenario format, ground-truth labels, and a localization-first scorer make cross-agent and cross-model comparisons directly comparable. |

## Overview

NetOpsBench provides: (1) an interactive and realistic environment mimicking production networks, with common tracing and telemetry tooling; (2) comprehensive and reproducible benchmarks covering a wide range of faults and failures; (3) an extensible architecture with an open SDK to readily integrate with various agent paradigms and observability tools, allowing users to try out their own agentic workflows.

It is built for researchers and engineers who want to compare LLM-backed, symbolic, heuristic, or hybrid troubleshooting strategies on the same operational benchmark, not just on static logs or hand-written prompts.

## News

- **2026-05**: 🎉 **Initial Release** - NetOpsBench is now available as an open arena for agentic network troubleshooting.
  - Provide public SDK with `run_scenario()` and `run_suite()` APIs to launch live network environments from Python.
  - Equip native MCP tools of complete observability utilities and pre-configured SONiC-VS network covering XS, Small, Medium and Large scales.
  - Offer fault scenario generation scripts and an expanding repository of reproducible fault cases with standard ground truth labels.
  - A full-fledged benchmark evaluator that accesses detection accuracy and token utilization efficiency.

## Quick Start

> NetOpsBench runtime execution requires Linux because Containerlab depends on Linux networking primitives.

### Install and run via CLI

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NetX-lab/NetOpsBench.git
cd NetOpsBench

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[agent]"

netopsbench benchmark prepare --scales xs
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
PYTHONPATH=. python examples/01_run_scenario.py --vendor openai
```

The first successful run produces a `BenchmarkReport` with case-level scores, timing, and artifact paths. For Docker, Containerlab, and runtime setup details, read [Quickstart](docs/content/docs/quickstart.mdx).

### Run a scenario from Python

```python
from examples.agents import MinimalDeepAgent
from netopsbench.sdk import NetOpsBench

scenario = "scenarios/generated/xs/generated_link_down_xs_001.yaml"

with NetOpsBench(workspace=".") as bench:
    agent = bench.agents.wrap(MinimalDeepAgent(vendor="openai"))
    run = bench.sessions.run_scenario(scenario=scenario, agent=agent)
    report = run.wait()

print(report.summary)
```

Scenario YAML files define the benchmark case: topology scale, traffic profile, fault type, target device, and interface-level ground truth when applicable. Use the [Python API Guide](docs/content/docs/build-your-agent/python-api-guide.mdx) for `run_scenario(...)`, `run_suite(...)`, and `workers=N`; see [Custom Troubleshooting Agents](docs/content/docs/build-your-agent/custom-agents.mdx) when you are ready to replace `MinimalDeepAgent` with your own strategy.

## Benchmark Results

NetOpsBench reports detection, fault type, device/interface localization, runtime, tool calls, and token usage so troubleshooting quality and operational cost can be compared together.
